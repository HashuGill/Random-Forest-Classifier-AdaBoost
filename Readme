What I learned:
  
  Math and Algorthim behind the Random Forest Classification 
  AdaBoost (Adaptive boosting) and how it creates a strong classifiers from weak classifiers
  Sklearn API for Random Forest and Adaboost machine learning algorthims  


The weak classifier has an accuracy of 0.7811447811447811
The boosted classifier has an accuracy of 0.9090909090909091
